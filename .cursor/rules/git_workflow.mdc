# Git Workflow Guidelines

1.  **Main Branches:**
    *   `main` (or `master`): Production-ready. No direct commits. Merges from `develop` or `release/*`.
    *   `develop`: Primary integration branch for ongoing development.
2.  **Supporting Branches:**
    *   `feature/*`: Branched from `develop`, merged back to `develop` via PR.
    *   `bugfix/*`: Branched from `develop` (or `main` for critical), merged back to `develop` (and `main` if needed) via PR.
    *   `release/*`: Branched from `develop`, merged to `main` and `develop`.
    *   `hotfix/*`: Branched from `main`, merged to `main` and `develop`.
3.  **Pull Requests (PRs):**
    *   Mandatory for merges into `develop` and `main`.
    *   Require code review (even self-review).
    *   Link to issues, provide clear descriptions.
    *   Require passing CI checks (lint, test, build).
4.  **Commit Messages:**
    *   Use **Conventional Commits** format (`type(scope): subject`).
    *   Types: `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`.
    *   Keep commits small and focused.
5.  **General Practices:**
    *   Use `git pull --rebase` regularly on feature branches.
    *   Resolve conflicts locally before pushing.
    *   Delete feature branches after merging.
